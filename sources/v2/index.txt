Minus.com API v2 Reference
==========================

At the lowest level, Minus exposes its API with a REST, http-accessible, API. We have designed our API to allow you to easily create folders and upload files programmatically.

Authentication
--------------

To use the Minus API the developers have to register their applications. Every
application gets an ID and a secret which allows the Minus to identify and 
authenticate the requests from the applications. 

We have a short overview about oAuth 2.0, which is the only way of the 
authentication and authorization. 

The tutorial section shows practical examples to implement oAuth 2.0 on the client
side.

.. note::
    During the testing period developers should request an API key via email.
