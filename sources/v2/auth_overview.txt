oAuth 2.0 authentication overview
=================================


Minus implemented the oAuth 2.0 specification, however it's still a draft. 
Our implementation tries to follow the changes of the specification.

oAuth 2.0 specification:
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-21


Access Token
""""""""""""

Access tokens are credentials used to access Minus API resources.

Refresh Token
"""""""""""""

Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens 
are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain 
a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires.

Authorization Grant
"""""""""""""""""""

An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource
owner's authorization (to access its protected resources) used by the
client to obtain an access token.  This specification defines four
grant types: authorization code, implicit, resource owner password
credentials, and client credentials, as well as an extensibility
mechanism for defining additional types.

.. warning::
    At the moment we only support "Resource Owner Password Credentials".

Client_id and Client_secret
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Client applications identifies themself with a client_id client_secret pair.

Scopes
""""""

Scopes are used to restrict applications by the users.

Available scopes:

    :read_public: Read public files
    :read_all: Read all folders and files
    :upload_new: Upload new files and folders
    :modify_all: Delete/Modify all existing files and folders
    :modify_user: Modify user preferences

Applications can obtain access token with more scopes.
